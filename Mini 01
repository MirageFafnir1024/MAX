<h1>Stuff I did so far</h1>

and exercising with my family. We did a bit of stretching and also a
 lot of riding my bike. down below is my bike!</p>

<p>That was my bike, and I am going to talk a bit about it. I got it when I 
turned 9, and I got it because my other bike got it's wheel punctured. and
ever since, I have loved to ride on it. Nowadays, I make many records. My
current record is 170 Laps!!!</p>

<p>I also did a bit of exercise. Me and my family sometimes exercise, and 
do exercises together. Sadly, I have no pictures, but I did do  a bit with my
family. It was really really fun.</p>
<br>
<p>Over-all I had a great time with my family this summer, and I wanted to
share my experience. See you all soon!</p>
