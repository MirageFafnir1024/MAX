<h1>Stuff I did so far</h1>
<br>
<div class= "sport">
<p>This summmer, we did a lot of fun things! We studied, and had fun
outside, and did a lot of fun things! But there were a few things we didn't do.
I'll talk about what I want to do.</p>
<br>
<p>First, I want to play sports with my family. I love to play cricket, and 
other sports, but it is best to do that stuff with my family. I really 
want to play sports with them, and have a great time.</p>
</div>
<br>
<div class= "hiker">
<p>I love hiking, and as a scout, there's no reason I shouldn't. I love to 
hike, and summer is the perfect time to do it. I would love to go on more hikes
that is something that I look forward to do.</p>
</div>
<br>
<div class= "quality">
<p>But like all people, and families, I would love to have quality time with
my family, and enjoy a movie, or board-game with my family. I want to make the
most out of this summer, and be sure to have a great time. </p>
<br>
<p>Over-all I had a great time with my family this summer, and hope to have more.
I wanted to share my experience with you all. See you all soon!</p>
